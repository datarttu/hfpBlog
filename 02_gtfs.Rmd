**TODO: GTFS stuff, HSL, Transitfeeds etc.**

Since I'm using HFP data from July 2019, I looked for the latest GTFS package covering that period of time.
It is from 21 June 2019 and can be found [here](https://transitfeeds.com/p/helsinki-regional-transport/735/20190621).
Download and uncompress the package, and place the files in `rawdata/gtfs/`.

There is a weird little error with the `stops.txt` file in the HSL feed:
the `parent_station` field is populated with a whitespace wherever the stop has no parent, although the field should be just empty in that case.
You can open the file and use search & replace to replace the `", ,"` occurrences with `",,"`, or if using Linux, do this:

```
sed -i -e 's/, ,/,,/g' stops.txt
```
